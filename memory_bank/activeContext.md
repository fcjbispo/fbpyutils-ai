# Active Context: FBPyUtils-AI

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on planning and implementing release v0.1.2, which involves removing all MCP implementations and updating relevant documentation.

## Recent Changes

- Initiated planning for release v0.1.2 to remove MCP implementations.
- Removed `fbpyutils_ai/servers` directory.
- Updated `tests_integration/test_scrape_server_integration.py` to remove MCP-related imports and tests.
- Updated `TREE.md` to reflect the removal of the `servers` directory.
- Updated `TODO.md` to remove MCP-specific mentions.
- Updated `README.md` to remove MCP-related sections and mentions.
- Updated `memory_bank/techContext.md` to remove MCP-related mentions.
- Updated `memory_bank/systemPatterns.md` to remove MCP-related sections and mentions.
- Updated `memory_bank/projectbrief.md` to remove MCP-related mentions.
- Updated `memory_bank/progress.md` to remove MCP-related mentions.
- Updated `PLAN.md` to include `PLAN_007_RELEASE_V0.1.2_REMOVE_MCP.md`.

## Next Steps

1. Ensure all documentation (`README.md`, `TODO.md`, `TOOLS.md`, `TREE.md`) is fully updated and consistent with version 0.1.1.
2. Update `memory_bank/progress.md` to reflect the current status and future plans.
3. Address the remaining items in `TODO.md`, focusing on UI improvements, new tool development, and increasing test coverage.
4. Organize and rename `PLAN_` files in sequential order (e.g., `PLAN_001_...md`).

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Ensuring the Memory Bank accurately reflects the information across all provided project files, including recent code changes and new files.
- The `tests_integration/gato.jpg` file is an image used in the LLM integration test for image description. It should be included in the repository.
- Documenting the changes in scrape and search tools and the new dependency in the Memory Bank.
- The Marimo interface was implemented with `mo.ui.sidebar` for better tool organization.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- Maintaining a clear and structured Memory Bank is crucial for effective project understanding and continuation.
- Information should be synthesized and summarized in the Memory Bank rather than simply copied verbatim from project files.
- Adhering to the defined Memory Bank file structure and purpose.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- The project has a clear structure with dedicated modules for different tool categories.
- Abstract base classes are used to define interfaces, promoting flexibility.
- The project leverages numerous external libraries, indicating a reliance on the Python ecosystem.
- There are existing UI components (`inspector`, `marimo`) that should be documented as part of the project.
- The `TODO.md` file provides a good overview of the implementation status and remaining work, particularly regarding test coverage and integrating examples from `DOC.md` into proper tools.
- Git rebase is a useful strategy for integrating remote changes when local history needs to be preserved cleanly on top of the remote branch.
- There is a significant need to increase test coverage across the project, as highlighted in `TODO.md` and `progress.md`.
- Several planned features are not yet fully implemented and require dedicated development effort.
- The scrape and search tools have been updated, possibly due to API or underlying library changes.
- A new dependency (`tabulate`) has been added, indicating the need to format data into tables somewhere in the project.
- The Marimo user interface has been introduced to demonstrate AI tools interactively.
