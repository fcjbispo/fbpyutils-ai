# Active Context: FBPyUtils-AI

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on consolidating the v0.1.1 release, updating all project documentation and the Memory Bank to reflect the current project version and code coverage, and organizing the plan files.

## Recent Changes

- Converted the LLM OpenAI integration test script (`tests_integration/test_llm_openai_integration.py`) to use pytest format.
- Marked Phase 5 of the HTTP Retry Centralization Plan (`PLAN_CENTRALIZE_HTTP_RETRY.md`) as completed.
- Identified modifications in `fbpyutils_ai/tools/http.py`, `fbpyutils_ai/tools/llm/__init__.py`, and `fbpyutils_ai/ui/marimo/app.llm_tool.py`.
- Noticed a new untracked file: `tests_integration/gato.jpg`.
- **Scrape and Search Tools Updates:**
    - Scrape success logic adjusted to use `statusCode` in metadata.
    - Field validation and link handling in scrape updated.
    - `firecrawl` library scrape function parameters changed to direct named parameters.
    - Removal of `method="GET"` parameter in asynchronous search.
    - Added `.json()` call to process HTTP responses as JSON in search functions.
- **Dependency Addition:**
    - Added `tabulate>=0.9.0` dependency in `pyproject.toml`.
- **Marimo UI Updates (Version 0.1.1):**
    - Implemented a new "Home" page in `fbpyutils_ai/ui/marimo/app.py` providing a project overview and links to tools.
    - Implemented "Generate Text" and "Generate Embeddings" sub-sessions in the LLM UI tool (`fbpyutils_ai/ui/marimo/app.py`).
    - Updated `README.md` to include a section on the Marimo UI Home page and reflect version 0.1.1, including the new LLM functionalities.
    - Updated `TODO.md` to include new next steps and reflect version 0.1.1, including the completion of new LLM UI sub-sessions.
    - Updated `TOOLS.md` and `TREE.md` to reflect version 0.1.1 and the new LLM UI functionalities.
- **Marimo UI Creation:**
    - Created the `fbpyutils_ai/ui/marimo/app.firecrawl_tool.py` module for the `FireCrawlTool`.
    - Created the main module `fbpyutils_ai/ui/marimo/app.main.py` using `mo.ui.sidebar` to integrate the LLM, Search, and Scrape tools.
    - Updated `README.md`, `TODO.md`, `TOOLS.md`, and `TREE.md` to reflect the new Marimo UI.

## Next Steps

1. Ensure all documentation (`README.md`, `TODO.md`, `TOOLS.md`, `TREE.md`) is fully updated and consistent with version 0.1.1.
2. Update `memory_bank/progress.md` to reflect the current status and future plans.
3. Address the remaining items in `TODO.md`, focusing on UI improvements, new tool development, and increasing test coverage.
4. Organize and rename `PLAN_` files in sequential order (e.g., `PLAN_001_...md`).

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Ensuring the Memory Bank accurately reflects the information across all provided project files, including recent code changes and new files.
- The `tests_integration/gato.jpg` file is an image used in the LLM integration test for image description. It should be included in the repository.
- Documenting the changes in scrape and search tools and the new dependency in the Memory Bank.
- The Marimo interface was implemented with `mo.ui.sidebar` for better tool organization.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- Maintaining a clear and structured Memory Bank is crucial for effective project understanding and continuation.
- Information should be synthesized and summarized in the Memory Bank rather than simply copied verbatim from project files.
- Adhering to the defined Memory Bank file structure and purpose.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- The project has a clear structure with dedicated modules for different tool categories.
- Abstract base classes are used to define interfaces, promoting flexibility.
- MCP servers are the primary mechanism for agent interaction, but direct library usage is also supported.
- The project leverages numerous external libraries, indicating a reliance on the Python ecosystem.
- There are existing UI components (`inspector`, `marimo`) that should be documented as part of the project.
- The `TODO.md` file provides a good overview of the implementation status and remaining work, particularly regarding test coverage and integrating examples from `DOC.md` into proper tools.
- Git rebase is a useful strategy for integrating remote changes when local history needs to be preserved cleanly on top of the remote branch.
- There is a significant need to increase test coverage across the project, as highlighted in `TODO.md` and `progress.md`.
- Several planned features are not yet fully implemented and require dedicated development effort.
- The scrape and search tools have been updated, possibly due to API or underlying library changes.
- A new dependency (`tabulate`) has been added, indicating the need to format data into tables somewhere in the project.
- The Marimo user interface has been introduced to demonstrate AI tools interactively.
