# Product Context: FBPyUtils-AI

## Why this project exists

The FBPyUtils-AI project addresses the need for a standardized and easily accessible set of tools that Artificial Intelligence agents can leverage to interact with the external world. While large language models (LLMs) are powerful, they often lack direct access to real-time information, external services, and structured data. This project bridges that gap by providing a Python library that wraps various functionalities (web search, scraping, data handling, API interaction, document conversion, vector databases) into a format consumable by AI agents, both directly through the library modules (e.g., `crawl.py`, `document.py`) and through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Problems it solves

-   **Limited Agent Capabilities:** AI agents often struggle to perform tasks requiring external data retrieval, interaction with web services, or processing of various document and data formats.
-   **Fragmented Tooling:** Developers building AI applications may need to integrate multiple disparate libraries and APIs to provide agents with necessary capabilities.
-   **Complexity of Integration:** Integrating external tools and data sources with AI agents can be complex and time-consuming.

## How it should work

The library should provide a collection of well-defined tools, implemented as Python classes and functions within various modules (e.g., `tools/search.py`, `tools/crawl.py`, `tools/document.py`). These tools should be designed with clear inputs and outputs, making them easy for AI agents to understand and utilize directly. Additionally, an MCP server is provided to expose a subset of these tools as callable functions for agents interacting via MCP. Basic UI components are also included to assist developers in understanding and using the tools.

## User experience goals

While the primary "users" are AI agents, the project also aims to provide a positive experience for the developers building and utilizing these agents:

-   **Ease of Integration:** Developers should find it straightforward to integrate the `fbpyutils_ai` library and its MCP server into their AI agent frameworks (e.g., LangChain, AutoGen).
-   **Clear Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation should enable developers to quickly understand the available tools, their parameters, and expected outputs, whether using the library directly or via MCP.
-   **Reliable Tools:** The tools should be robust and handle errors gracefully.
-   **Developer Assistance:** The basic UI components should provide helpful visual aids for development and debugging.
