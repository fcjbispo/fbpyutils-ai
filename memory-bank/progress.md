# Progress: FBPyUtils-AI (Version 0.1.1)

## What Works

Based on the provided `README.md`, `TODO.md`, and the file structure, the following functionalities are implemented to some extent:

-   **Internet Search:** Implemented via `SearXNGTool` and exposed through `mcp_search_server`.
-   **Web Content Extraction:** Implemented via `FireCrawlTool` (v1 API with supported methods for self-hosted mode) and exposed through `mcp_scrape_server`. Tests moved to `tests/scrape/`.
-   **HTTP Requests:** Core functionality available via `HTTPClient` and `RequestsManager`. Updated to handle Gzip/JSON and removed PUT/DELETE methods.
-   **Document Conversion:** Basic conversion available via `DoclingConverter`.
-   **Vector Database Interaction:** Interfaces and implementations for ChromaDB, PgVector, and Pinecone are present.
-   **LLM Interaction:** OpenAI-compatible LLM interaction, including text generation, embeddings, and vision, is available via `LiteLLMServiceTool`. The Marimo UI now includes dedicated sub-sessions for "Generate Text" and "Generate Embeddings".
-   **Marimo UI for AI Tools:** New UI for demonstrating AI tools, including `app.main.py`, `app.llm_tool.py`, `app.search_tool.py`, `app.firecrawl_tool.py`, and a new "Home" page with project overview and tool links.
-   **Project Plans Overview:** A consolidated `PLAN.md` file has been created, summarizing all individual planning documents (`PLAN_*.md`) in a structured table format.

## What's Left to Build

According to `TODO.md`, `TOOLS.md`, and recent feedback, the following features need full implementation or significant work:

-   **Excel Manipulation Tool:** Not yet implemented. Examples (`openpyxl`, `pandas`) in DOC.md need integration into a dedicated tool.
-   **Text File Manipulation Tool:** `DoclingConverter` handles conversion, but dedicated tools for basic read/write of specific formats (JSON, CSV, HTML, MD, XML) as described in TOOLS.md needs dedicated implementation and tests.
-   **Image Reading/Description Tool:** `LiteLLMServiceTool.describe_image` exists, but dedicated tools or full integration of examples using libraries like OpenCV and CLIP from `DOC.md` are needed.
-   **Image Creation from Prompts Tool:** Partial implementation potentially via `LiteLLMServiceTool`, but needs explicit implementation and tests for image *creation*. DALL-E example in DOC.md needs integration or dedicated tool.
-   **General SQL Database Reading Tool:** `PgVectorDB` exists for vector operations, but a general tool for reading from SQL databases as planned in `TOOLS.md` is needed. Examples (`sqlite3`, `SQLAlchemy`) in DOC.md need integration or dedicated tools.
-   **Finish Basic UI Tools:** Complete the basic functionality for the `inspector` and `marimo` UI tools.
-   **Increase Test Coverage:** Achieve a minimum code coverage of 90% for the current branch code development, as required by `../VIBE.md`.
-   **Next Steps (from TODO.md):**
    -   Melhoria na interface da UI marimo com inclusao de novas funcinalidades e correcoes.
    -   Desenvolvimento das proximas ferramentas previstas.
    -   Aumento da cobertura dos testes unitarios e funcionais.

## Current Status

-   Successfully rebased the local `v0.1.1` branch with the latest changes from the remote.
-   Core web interaction (search, scraping, HTTP) and LLM interaction tools are partially or fully implemented.
-   Document conversion and vector database integration are initiated.
-   Basic UI components are present, and the "Home" page, "Generate Text", and "Generate Embeddings" sub-sessions have been implemented in the Marimo UI.
-   All features for release v0.1.1 have been implemented and tested.
-   Overall test coverage is 36.56%, indicating a need for substantial testing effort to reach the 90% target. Specific modules like `mcp_search_server.py` (0%), `mcp_scrape_server.py` (9.47%), `DoclingConverter` (0%), `PgVectorDB` (low coverage), and `HTTPClient`/`RequestsManager` (18.44%) have particularly low test coverage.
-   Documentation (`README.md`, `TODO.md`, `TOOLS.md`, `TREE.md`) has been updated to reflect version 0.1.1, the new UI Home page, and the new LLM UI functionalities.

## Known Issues

-   Low test coverage across many modules, posing a risk to stability and reliability.
-   Examples provided in `DOC.md` for some planned tools (Excel, image processing, SQL) are not yet integrated into the main tool structure.
-   Specific server modules (`mcp_search_server.py`, `mcp_scrape_server.py`) and tools (`DoclingConverter`, `PgVectorDB`, `HTTPClient`/`RequestsManager`) have particularly low test coverage.
-   Basic UI tools (`inspector`, `marimo`) are not yet fully functional, though the "Home" page, "Generate Text", and "Generate Embeddings" sub-sessions are now implemented.
-   Documentation is now up-to-date with the current v0.1.1 deliveries, reflecting the latest UI changes.
