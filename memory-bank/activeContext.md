# Active Context: FBPyUtils-AI

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on updating the Memory Bank to accurately reflect the current state of the project after resolving git conflicts and rebasing the local branch onto the latest remote changes.

## Recent Changes

- Successfully rebased the local `v0.1.1` branch onto the latest changes from the remote `origin/v0.1.1`, resolving divergent history.
- Updated `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md` to align with the current project scope, architecture, technologies, and context.
- Updated `progress.md` to detail the current implementation status of features, remaining work, and test coverage based on `TODO.md` and the project files.
- Refactored the parsing logic for `llm_providers.md` in `fbpyutils_ai/tools/llm/utils.py`.
- Added new unit tests for LLM utility functions in `tests/tools/llm/`.

## Next Steps

1. Review all updated Memory Bank files to ensure consistency and accuracy.
2. Attempt completion to inform the user that the Memory Bank has been updated and I am ready to proceed.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Ensuring the Memory Bank accurately reflects the information across all provided project files, especially regarding feature implementation status and test coverage.
- Structuring the information in the Memory Bank files according to the defined hierarchy and purpose of each file.
- Incorporating feedback received during the update process (e.g., including UI features, clarifying direct library usage).
- Confirming the successful rebase before proceeding with documentation updates.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- Maintaining a clear and structured Memory Bank is crucial for effective project understanding and continuation.
- Information should be synthesized and summarized in the Memory Bank rather than simply copied verbatim from project files.
- Adhering to the defined Memory Bank file structure and purpose.
- Using rebase to integrate remote changes when local and remote branches have diverged.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- The project has a clear structure with dedicated modules for different tool categories.
- Abstract base classes are used to define interfaces, promoting flexibility.
- MCP servers are the primary mechanism for agent interaction, but direct library usage is also supported.
- The project leverages numerous external libraries, indicating a reliance on the Python ecosystem.
- There are existing UI components (`inspector`, `marimo`) that should be documented as part of the project.
- The `TODO.md` file provides a good overview of the implementation status and remaining work, particularly regarding test coverage and integrating examples from `DOC.md` into proper tools.
- Git rebase is a useful strategy for integrating remote changes when local history needs to be preserved cleanly on top of the remote branch.
- There is a significant need to increase test coverage across the project, as highlighted in `TODO.md` and `progress.md`.
- Several planned features are not yet fully implemented and require dedicated development effort.
