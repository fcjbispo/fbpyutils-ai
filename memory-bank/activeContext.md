# Active Context: FBPyUtils-AI

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on updating the Memory Bank to accurately reflect the current state of the project after incorporating recent code changes and new files, and completing the conversion of the LLM OpenAI integration test.

## Recent Changes

- Converted the LLM OpenAI integration test script (`tests_integration/test_llm_openai_integration.py`) to use pytest format.
- Marked Phase 5 of the HTTP Retry Centralization Plan (`PLAN_CENTRALIZE_HTTP_RETRY.md`) as completed.
- Identified modifications in `fbpyutils_ai/tools/http.py`, `fbpyutils_ai/tools/llm/__init__.py`, and `fbpyutils_ai/ui/marimo/app.llm_tool.py`.
- Noticed a new untracked file: `tests_integration/gato.jpg`.

## Next Steps

1. Commit the remaining changes (`fbpyutils_ai/tools/http.py`, `fbpyutils_ai/tools/llm/__init__.py`, `fbpyutils_ai/ui/marimo/app.llm_tool.py`, and `tests_integration/gato.jpg`).
2. Continue with the next tasks related to the HTTP Retry Centralization Plan or other pending work.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Ensuring the Memory Bank accurately reflects the information across all provided project files, including recent code changes and new files.
- The `tests_integration/gato.jpg` file is an image used in the LLM integration test for image description. It should be included in the repository.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- Maintaining a clear and structured Memory Bank is crucial for effective project understanding and continuation.
- Information should be synthesized and summarized in the Memory Bank rather than simply copied verbatim from project files.
- Adhering to the defined Memory Bank file structure and purpose.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- The project has a clear structure with dedicated modules for different tool categories.
- Abstract base classes are used to define interfaces, promoting flexibility.
- MCP servers are the primary mechanism for agent interaction, but direct library usage is also supported.
- The project leverages numerous external libraries, indicating a reliance on the Python ecosystem.
- There are existing UI components (`inspector`, `marimo`) that should be documented as part of the project.
- The `TODO.md` file provides a good overview of the implementation status and remaining work, particularly regarding test coverage and integrating examples from `DOC.md` into proper tools.
- Git rebase is a useful strategy for integrating remote changes when local history needs to be preserved cleanly on top of the remote branch.
- There is a significant need to increase test coverage across the project, as highlighted in `TODO.md` and `progress.md`.
- Several planned features are not yet fully implemented and require dedicated development effort.
