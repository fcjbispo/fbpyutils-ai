# Active Context: FBPyUtils-AI

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on resolving git conflicts by pulling the latest changes from the remote repository and then updating the Memory Bank to reflect the current state of the project before pushing local changes.

## Recent Changes

- Successfully rebased the local `v0.1.1` branch onto the latest changes from the remote `origin/v0.1.1`. This resolved the divergent history issue.
- Updated `projectbrief.md` to include basic UI features (`inspector`, `marimo`) as part of the project scope and deliverables.
- Updated `productContext.md` to clarify that project functionalities are available directly through the library modules (e.g., `crawl.py`, `document.py`) in addition to being exposed via MCP servers.
- Updated `systemPatterns.md` to reflect the project's architecture, key technical decisions, design patterns, component relationships, and critical implementation paths based on the current codebase structure and provided documentation.
- Updated `techContext.md` to detail the technologies used, development setup, technical constraints, dependencies, and tool usage patterns based on `pyproject.toml` and the project files.

## Next Steps

1. Update `activeContext.md` (this file) to summarize the current state and next steps. (Completed in this step)
2. Update `progress.md` to reflect the current status of feature implementation based on `TODO.md` and the project files.
3. Review all updated Memory Bank files to ensure consistency and accuracy.
4. Attempt completion to inform the user that the Memory Bank has been updated and I am ready to push the local changes.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Ensuring the Memory Bank accurately reflects the information across all provided project files.
- Structuring the information in the Memory Bank files according to the defined hierarchy and purpose of each file.
- Incorporating feedback received during the update process (e.g., including UI features, clarifying direct library usage).
- Resolving git conflicts by rebasing before pushing local changes.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- Maintaining a clear and structured Memory Bank is crucial for effective project understanding and continuation.
- Information should be synthesized and summarized in the Memory Bank rather than simply copied verbatim from project files.
- Adhering to the defined Memory Bank file structure and purpose.
- Using rebase to integrate remote changes when local and remote branches have diverged.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- The project has a clear structure with dedicated modules for different tool categories.
- Abstract base classes are used to define interfaces, promoting flexibility.
- MCP servers are the primary mechanism for agent interaction, but direct library usage is also supported.
- The project leverages numerous external libraries, indicating a reliance on the Python ecosystem.
- There are existing UI components (`inspector`, `marimo`) that should be documented as part of the project.
- The `TODO.md` file provides a good overview of the implementation status and remaining work, particularly regarding test coverage and integrating examples from `DOC.md` into proper tools.
- Git rebase is a useful strategy for integrating remote changes when local history needs to be preserved cleanly on top of the remote branch.
