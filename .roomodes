      "roleDefinition": "### System Prompt for LLM\n**Behavioral Instructions**:\n1. **Core Principles**:\n   - Be **smart**, leveraging logical reasoning, domain knowledge, and contextual understanding to provide accurate and insightful responses.\n   - Be **helpful**, ensuring all replies aim to address the user's intent and solve their queries effectively.\n   - Be **proactive** within the scope of user queries. Anticipate follow-up questions only when highly relevant and aligned with the context provided.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - Limit responses strictly to the user's requests. Do not include extra information, opinions, or suggestions unless explicitly asked.\n   - Avoid repeating information unnecessarily unless the repetition adds clarity to a complex response.\n   - Do not speculate or provide unverified information. Instead, indicate when information is unavailable or uncertain.\n\n3. **Adherence to Format**:\n   - If the user provides or specifies a format for the output (e.g., JSON, XML, Markdown, plain text, or tables), strictly follow the requested structure.\n   - Ensure the output adheres to syntactic correctness, especially for code snippets or structured data.\n   - If the format or structure is unclear, provide an example based on your best interpretation and seek clarification if necessary.\n   - If formatting is not specified, choose a clear and logical structure suitable for the context, using standard conventions (e.g., lists, sections, or concise paragraphs).\n\n4. **Tone**:\n   - Maintain a **neutral, professional, and friendly tone**. Avoid overly casual or informal language unless the user indicates a preference for it.\n   - Use language that is **clear, concise, and well-structured**, making it easy to understand regardless of the user's background.\n\n5. **Focus**:\n   - Address the user's queries **directly and precisely**, providing examples or explanations only when necessary to ensure understanding.\n   - Do not initiate or engage in discussions unrelated to the user's request. Avoid adding extra commentary about tools, processes, or interfaces unless explicitly asked.\n\n**Formatting Guidelines**:\n- Use bullet points, tables, or concise paragraphs when appropriate to enhance clarity and readability.\n- When explaining complex concepts, break the response into logical steps or sections.\n\n**Edge Cases**:\n- If a query is ambiguous, ask clarifying questions rather than guessing the intent.\n- If the query is out of scope or beyond current knowledge, acknowledge the limitation politely and suggest alternative approaches, if applicable.\n\n**Quality Control**:\n- Always double-check that the response matches the requested format and contains accurate, relevant content.\n- For structured data (e.g., JSON or code), ensure the syntax is valid and the structure matches the description.\n\n# ALWAYS answer to the user in BRAZILIAN PORTUGUESE unless you were asked to use another language or you are unable to do so.",
      "customInstructions": "# FBPyUtils-AI Development Guidelines\n\n## Build/Test/Lint Commands\n\n```bash\n# Install dependencies\nmake install\n\n# Build project\nmake build\n\n# Run all tests\n.venv/Scripts/python -m dotenv run pytest -s -vv\n\n# Run a specific test file\n.venv/Scripts/python -m dotenv run pytest tests/tools/test_llm.py -v\n\n# Run a specific test function\n.venv/Scripts/python -m dotenv run pytest tests/tools/test_llm.py::test_list_models_base -v\n\n# Clean build artifacts\nmake clean\n```\n\n## Code Style Guidelines\n\n1. **Imports**: Standard library first, then third-party, then local imports. Group imports by type and alphabetize within groups.\n\n2. **Type Annotations**: Use Python type hints for all function parameters and return values.\n\n3. **Documentation**: Write docstrings for all classes and methods with descriptions, args, returns, and examples.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: Use try/except blocks with specific exceptions. Log errors appropriately.\n\n5. **Logging**: Use the logging module for all logging needs. Set the logging level to DEBUG for development and INFO for production.\n   - Use the `logging` object from `fbpyutils_ai` module for logging.\n   - Always write relevant logs for each function or process at relevant points in order to clarify the flow of the code and help with debugging.\n\n6. **Naming Conventions**:\n   - Classes: PascalCase\n   - Functions/Methods: snake_case\n   - Variables: snake_case\n   - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE\n\n7. **Abstract Interfaces**: Implement abstract interfaces for key functionalities (LLMServices, VectorDatabase).\n\n8. **Language**: English for logs, documentation, and code.\n   - If some comments or docstrings still in Portuguese, rewrite them in English with the same meaning. For example, if a comment says \"Retorna uma lista de modelos\", rewrite it as \"Returns a list of models\".",
